<h2>2025 03 16</h2>
<p>The bot boys enter the tavern. Over in a far corner, a woman dressed in a bright floral dress enjoys the distinctive bagpipe music being performed by a bard on the stage.</p>
<p>The more human appearing fellow, Thalion, notices the reflection of the empty stage in the dirty window. The stage currently holding the bard.</p>
<p>The barmaid dumps two drinks in front of them. Banhammer, Thalion&#39;s large entirely metal companion, does not consume humanoid beverages, and pushes his drink toward Thalion.</p>
<p>Aryn gives Charity a nod, pointing out the new arrivals. It&#39;s supposed to be subtle, but Thalion notices it anway. Charity dismisses the air of subterfuge altogether with a broad smile and a toast of her (as yet untouched) Unnamed Beverage, inviting them over to the table We introduce ourselves.</p>
<p>Some coins are donated to the bard on stage. History does not record who is generous.</p>
<p>A thin soup arrives unannounced, and Charity bravely samples it, making her Con save for it not to bounce right out again.</p>
<p>A guard rushes in, looking for someone, and finding us. &quot;You lot! The Duchess Morwen needs your help!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A band of wayward travellers are camped outside the walls. They&#39;re harassing the townsfolk. Guards have failed to chase them off, returning with positive reviews that seemed like they&#39;d been charmed.&quot;</p>
<p>The message the duchess wants delivered is &quot;Leave before dawn, or your wagons will be burned to the ground.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CF: took two silver</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We head to the north gate to visit these folk. They&#39;re very pleasant, with campfires and whatnot.</p>
<p>Thalion delivers the message from Duchess Morwen. Stanimere (the guy who greets us) laughs and agrees to move on later, but invites us to their campfire entertainment.</p>
<p>Stan spits a mouthful of spirit into the fire and it flares up into a magic fire-shape puppet thratre, that tells the story of these people as refugees, helping some guy to escape his enemies. He was a prince who helped them in return, offering them a home.</p>
<p>The prince has now been cursed, and they&#39;re looking for people to help save him. Madame Eva will tell us more.</p>
<p>The party goes pretty hard, Aryn competes in some vigorous sing-offs, and we wake up the next morning alone in a misty clearing. It&#39;s a different clearing than the one we started in.</p>
<p>We get some bearings and head south on a nearby road. The fog stays around, and town we came from isn&#39;t there, but after an hour we break out from the forest into an open area. The road turns to cobble. Tall village dwellings loom in the mist. It&#39;s quiet aside from sobbing, whimpering sounds occasionally echoing from a distance.</p>
<p>We head toward the sobbing and it&#39;s a pair of children. One says &quot;there&#39;s a monster in our house!&quot; and points to a nearby house.</p>
<p>Rose and Thorn Durst tell us that their parents kept a monster in the basement, they think it&#39;s eaten the parents, and their little brother Walter is still in the house on the top floor.</p>
<p>We head in. In the entry foyer there&#39;s a coat of arms (golden windmill on a red field) and some portraits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CF: acquires carrots from the pantry</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The kitchen has a dumbwaiter, but aside from that and carrots there&#39;s nothing much on the ground floor. We head up.</p>
<p>Charity finds a key in a desk in the library. The fireplace there has never been lit.</p>
<p>We head up another floor. This time, one of the decorative suits of armous springs to life. It cops attacks from all of us and Banhammer&#39;s massive hit scatter the pieces. Banhammer then barges into a broom closet, immediately triggering a magic broom to attack us. We get through this one as well.</p>
<p>In a nursery on the third floor we find a bundle of blankets in a crib. There&#39;s nothing in the blankets, but a nurse wraith scream to life and attacks us. We fight again; all our normal weapons seem to do less damage than they should.</p>
<p>We discover a secret up stair and follow it to the attic room, where we discover skeletons of two children, with the same clothing and doll as the Rose and Thorn we met outside. We peek in but don&#39;t enter yet, too creepy.</p>
<p>In another room we find a big chest with a corpse wrapped in a sheet. Also creepy.</p>
<p>The skeletons look like they simply died here, perhaps of starvation. The dollhouse is a flawless replica of the house we&#39;re in, and we discover secret doors in the library, and a secret stair from the attic down to the basement. However when we touch the dollhouse the ghost children appear in the room telling us not to touch their toys. They&#39;re not particularly angry, but don&#39;t recognise us, don&#39;t know where Sir Carrots is, and they still want us to kill the monster.</p>
<p>On the way out the kids&#39; room, Rose calls out &quot;No, don&#39;t leave&quot; but when she grabs at Charity, she and Thorn suddenly scream in pain and disappear.</p>

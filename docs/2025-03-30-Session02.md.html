<h1>Session 2</h1>
<h2>2025 03 30</h2>
<p>So we know about a few new secrets in the house, and decide to check the secret room on floor 2 before we go fight the basement monster.</p>
<p>The secret room is a small room with bookshelves and a chest against the far wall, with a skeleton positioned as if it had half climbed into the chest.</p>
<p>The bookshelves and desk include books about necromancy and summoning rituals, showing that the owners were priests of &quot;Osybus&quot;, whatever that is.</p>
<p>Thalion steps into the room and examines the skeleton. It&#39;s been killed by a dart trap, and is holding a letter written on fancy parchment.</p>
<pre><code>I am not a messiah sent to you by the Dark Powers of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the ones who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but worms writhing in my earth.

You say that you are cursed, your fortunes spent. You abandoned love for madness, took solace in the bosom of another woman, and sired a stillborn son. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.

Your dread lord and master,
Strahd von Zarovich
</code></pre>
<p>Thalion checks the chest, finding a bunch of stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>T: acquires three books (25gp each); three scrolls (Bless, Protection From Poison, Spiritual Weapon); the deed to this house; the deed to a windmill; a signed will bequeathing all this stuff to some other Dursts. Or maybe it was these Dursts?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We head for the basement. The narrow stair leads to a maze of narrow corridors carved out of clay and rock with stout wooden bracing. It feels like a mine.</p>
<p>We hear an eerie, incessant chanting throughout the area.</p>
<p>The first room we visit is an empty quarters with mouldy straw beds and a table and chairs. The next room contains a well with bucket. Banhammer operates the well but the rope snaps before he can get the bucket back up. This room has slightly nicer beds set into its alcoves, each with a padlocked chest.</p>
<p>Banhammer smacks the rusty locks with his hammer, breaking into the chests. Most of the contents are destroyed in the smashing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BH: acquires 30gp from a coin pouch made of human skin (discarding the pouch)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We find a room with a dining table and benches. There are humanoid bones strewn around, victims of the cult&#39;s cannibalism. Banhammer steps into a darkened alcove in this banquet room and a tentacled snake beast attacks us.</p>
<p>The fight is short but none of Charity&#39;s arrows hit -- it&#39;s as if she&#39;s shooting her bow for the first time.</p>
<p>Out from this room the chanting gets louder, and we&#39;re attacked by ghouls filtering into the corridors from a nearby room. Thalion turns them and several run off.</p>
<p>It&#39;s tight in the corridors. Charity backs up, ordering Aryn to kill the creatures on the way past. It&#39;s awkward and her accent is weird, but her next few shots land.</p>
<p>Banhammer is briefly paralysed by a ghoul but shakes it off, and we kill the last ghoul in this area.</p>
<p>Thalion and Banhammer rush off down a corridor chasing more ghouls, pursued by Charity and Aryn. Charity commands the others to continue attacking. We take out one escaping ghoul, then backtrack to pursue another. This second one has fled to a room with chained up skeletons and painted wood statues of a guy and a wolf. The statue guy holds an orb.</p>
<p>Charity throws a bone at the wood statue, then goes over to grab the orb. At that moment five Shadows appear surrounding Charity and attack.</p>
<p>Charity is wounded in the following fight. Afterward we inspect the orb, it&#39;s an arcane focus but not otherwise magical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>T: acquires orb, 25gb value</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We head out of the room but the door we choose is a mimic and Banhammer&#39;s hand sticks to it as the door grows a mouth and bites at him. The mimic door struggles to eat a metal adventurer and is eventually dispatched by Banhammer&#39;s strikes, assisted by arrows and spells from the group.</p>
<p>The mimic door was protecting a residence with antechamber and bedroom. Charity lifts the lid of a footlocker in the bedroom and two ghasts burst into the room. One is female looking and the other male looking, and they are wearing the Durst family crest on their tattered clothes.</p>
<p>They ignore Charity and fight the rest of the party. Charity moves into the corner of the room and watches in apparent delight, not attacking the creatures until the female one is killed, and then finally firing an arrow at the male.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BH: acquires a Cloak of Protection (+1 AC, +1 all Saving Throws); a potion of healing (2d4+2)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>T: acquires a potion of healing (2d4+2)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AC: acquires a potion of healing (2d4+2)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CF: acquires a potion of healing (2d4+2); a Flask of Alchemist Fire; Thieves Tools</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Group: acquires a mess kit, a lantern, a wizard&#39;s spellbook</p>

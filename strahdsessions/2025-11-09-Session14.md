Looking around after the fight we notice creatures moving around in the weird spooky tree area, and even see an axe buried in the big tree that way, but we're reluctant to do any more fighting.

Aryn climbs the twig and mud effigy looking for the gems we think are buried inside it. She struggles getting through the mud with her dagger and looks around for a better option, but nothing suggests itself.

Banhammer tries just smashing it the statue's knee area (it doesn't have well-defined legs, more of a wide column that becomes more humanoid-like above the waist). Banhammer's maul does seem to slowly be removing mud and sticks from the mass.

We realise that the top of the thing did cop a bit of fire damage from Strahd's fireball, and Charity remembers the Flask of Alchemist's Fire she found in the haunted house. She digs it out and smashes it into the chest of the big effigy. The top half of the thing quickly dries out under the heat of the fire, and over 10 to 15 mins the statue fully catches alight.

The statue burns for hours and we end up sleeping most of the night in its flickering light. By dawn, just a spiky stump remains, and on the stump is a glowing green gem. In the ashes tiny green shoots have already sprouted. Banhammer scoops up the gem and stows it in a torso compartment.

Banhammer proposes we go check out the creepy tree area. There's a shiny battleaxe buried in the tree, a corpse lying below the axe, and six needleblights moving around the three area. The tree is clearly evil and we consider if we've had enough evil trees for now, but after a second we decide we might as well clean the place up.

Banhammer steps to the edge of the circle of smaller plants and gives the central tree a hard stare. It appears not to respond to his approach, and blood seems to be leaking out of its trunk. He walks up to the tree and touches it, but then jerks back his hand as a surge of evil flows up his arm.

He reaches for the axe, the nearby bushes spring to life, and we're fighting.

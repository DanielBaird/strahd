Before we start, we review our card readings. (Daniel needs to update ep 6 to replace the old card info)

The woman in the room is moving carefully and rehearsed, like she's being taught how to do things for the first time. The Abbot trains her in sitting and being graceful.

He invites us in, friendly and welcoming, and bids us sit.

"What brings you here?"

BH: We're looking for our friend Ireena.

"You're the first visitors we've had forever."

T: Let's try again. You're creepy ass monsters kidnapped a friend of ours, we want her back.

"You're mistaken, my bellviews couldn't kidnap a person that's beyond them. You're welcome to search around, I hope you find what you need."

The men in the

Aryn: So tell me about the chimera people..

Charity butts in: So we're safe? Is that what you told spiderface batgirl outside?

"All of the bellviews are afllicted in some way, Marzina, the *batgirl* as you call her, has a unique case of paranoia, and for their own safety we need keep some of them restrained. Their fate is not yours -- unless you fall into insanity yourselves," and he smiles.

"You perhaps met Otto and Zigfrek outside; they are some of my better successes at helping the bellviews overcome their curse."

We disengage and head for the stairs up. The abbot calls "Clovin, we have guests, please come and accompany them on their tour of the abbey!" and the somber string music stops, and a creature comes clumping down the stairs, falling drunkenly down the last few. He's clearly drunk but agrees to show us around. His second, baby-like head hisses at us and we see it's snake-like tongue.

We head upstairs with Clovin as the abbot returns to training the woman who looks just like Ireena.

We arrive in a loft, the highest floor. There's a belfry above with a bell and descending rope. There's a body under a sheet. Banhammer asks if it's a body, and Clovin says "yeah".

BH peeks. Under the shroud is a collection of body parts, some of them are our own. We gasp but when we pick up the parts, we realise we were mistaken and they're "just" body parts from various women, waiting to be stitched together. We all share a look.

BH pushes open the door to the south. It leads to the ramparts that join the two wings. There are scarecrows dressed as soldiers here. We make our way across the ramparts to the southeast wing.

The room here is a dorm room with mouldering bunk beds. A woman jumps out and threatens Aryn with a knife. "Who are you?" she demands.

BH: Just looking for a mate (and describes Ireena).

"What use would you have for that monster down there!? Are you with the Abbot? Are you with Strahd? Why else would you be travelling with a *vampire*?" and she pricks Aryn with her dagger.

Charity, realising stuff about Aryn: "Aaahhhh, that makes sense."

Her name is Ezmerelda d'Avenir, and she seems to be a vampire hunter. We describe how Aryn is fine in the sun, so can't really be a vampire, and that we really are just looking for Ireena.

She relaxes slightly as she describes how the Abbot's intention is to build a girlfriend for Strahd, and Ezmerelda's plan is to ambush Strahd when he comes to collect her. She also believes that Ireena didn't come here, and she's been watching pretty carefully.

Thalion busts her balls a bit about the flaws in her vampire hunting plan, which apparently involves hiding in a crappy old dorm room. Ez eventually decides we aren't in league with Strahd or the Abbot.
